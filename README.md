# The Calibrator, a Cache-Memory and TLB Calibration Tool.
This tool was originally developed by [Stefan Manegold](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~manegold/) and has not been updated for many years. I manage to make some adaptions to make it compatible on newly released Linux kernels. 

## Environment
Linux kernel version >= 4.11.0  
CMake version >= 3.5.2

## Usage
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ../bin
./calibrator
```
